# Test Git Submodules
---
This git repo is to test the vaibility of using submodules for all integrations related process enhancements. This includes a submodule for preprocessing, a different one for Matching QA and more. Normally these would each get their own repositories, but since the projects are so small, we would like to test alternatives.
